# etch-a-sketch

## Post project

It was a fun project, and a good introduction to Javascript. If I however over a color square when in black and white mode it changes into the average rgb color. E.g. If color was 100, 150, 200, the black and white becomes 150, 150, 150. Each hover over increases black and white a little until it is completely dark.
